        I've had a few rough starts trying to get into college, but I finally have a real chance this year, having completed Pathways. I hope I can finish my schooling this time. The dream is to get into programming games, but even getting into websites would be good.

        I served as a young church service missionary for two years at the Church Office Building in downtown Salt Lake City. I helped the older service missionaries with their computer issues, and maintained a sharepoint site for service missionaries across the nation.
