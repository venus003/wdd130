                Hello, Nathan here. My wife and I have a dog named Layla. I'm from Utah, currently living in Houston Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dream is to get into programming games, but going into websites would be good as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I served as a young church service missionary for two years at the Church Office Building in downtown Salt Lake City. I helped the older service missionaries with their computer issues, and maintained a sharepoint site for service missionaries across the nation.
