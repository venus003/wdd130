                <p>
                    So, you fell into a vat of toxic waste. Nevermind any side affects, you are now a super! Donned with superpowers, your very existence has been enhanced. The question is, what will you do with your newfound powers? Some people struggle with doing the right thing when they get powers. They may be selfish at first, using them for personal gain or enjoyment. This does not make them a bad hero, misguided perhaps, but something might happen to them before they learn their lesson. If they do not reign in their personal vendetta they may become an anti-hero or vigilante, or worse, the villain.

                <h2>Your Path</h2>
                <p>
                    You have several paths you can choose. You can choose the path of a superhero by doing good for others, sometimes at your own expense. You can choose the path of a villain by doing things for yourself at the expense of others. There are also things in between that you may become. Which path will you choose?
