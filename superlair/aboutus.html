                <h2>The Powers Begin</h2>
                <p>
                    A long time ago, there were no supers. Ours used to be a universe devoid of beings who possessed superpowers. Then, one day, The First created a pocket dimension out of sheer will. From that pocket dimension, The First drew out endless human potential that manifested as superpowers, that changed dozens of humans into supers in the blink of a eye. Since then, hundreds more have been born with superpowers. Others, well, fall into it. Sometimes literally. Maybe you're one of the lucky few that fell into a vat of toxic waste and acquired superpowers! At the Super Lair, we guide the new super on their journey to stardom.

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    The Super Lair all started with the Boss. The Boss saw so many supers struggle with their new reality of having superpowers, starting with the Boss's child, ChatterBox. ChatterBox fell into a vat of toxic waste at the age of 15, and gained superhuman abilities. ChatterBox did not take to being a super well at all. So, the Boss founded the Super Lair, to help new supers everywhere. The Boss's family moved to the Moon and built the Super Lair Headquarters in the Sea of Tranquility. Today, we span across the universe to serve supers like you.
