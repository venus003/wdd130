        Congratulations, you are now a super! Be it hero, villain, or something in between, you now have superpowers. No matter who you are or how you got here, there is something here for everyone. Supers, like you, gain infinite potential when they use the Super Lair for their super needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>A Humble Abode</b><br>

        Very important to a super, their personal super lair offers solace and acts as a base of operations. It can be as small as a studio apartment, or as tall as a skyscraper, or as isolated as an underground cave. You can be alone in your lair, hang out with your sidekick there, or your team can run experiments with you in the laboratory. No matter what the size, your lair should address your super needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Invitation</b><br>
      
        The Super Lair is a place to take a break, rest up, and plan your next steps on your super journey. In fact, if your superpowers include traveling through the internet, then by all means, come rest in the Super Lair's web servers at any time!

      <h3>Your Journey</h3>
      <p>
        There are many different ways that superpowers can be acquired. However, some ways may be dangerous. Here are but a few ways that your super journey may have begun:
      </p>
      <p>
        WARNING: Do not attempt any unsafe actions to gain superpowers
        <li>Obtaining a supersuit or other man-made tech</li>
        <li>Make a pact with a powerful being</li>
        <li>Obtaining an alien artifact</li>
        <li>Freak accidents (animal bites, radiation, etc)</li>
        <li>Study of magic or fighting styles</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Welcome</b><br>

        So, you fell into a vat of toxic waste. Nevermind any side affects, you are now a super! Donned with superpowers, your very existence has been enhanced. The question is, what will you do with your newfound powers? Some people struggle with doing the right thing when they get powers. They may be selfish at first, using them for personal gain or enjoyment. This does not make them a bad hero, misguided perhaps, but something might happen to them before they learn their lesson. If they do not reign in their personal vendetta they may become an anti-hero or vigilante, or worse, the villain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Your Path</b><br>

        You have several paths you can choose. You can choose the path of a superhero by doing good for others, sometimes at your own expense. You can choose the path of a villain by doing things for yourself at the expense of others. There are also things in between that you may become. Which path will you choose?

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        <b>The Powers Begin</b><br>

        A long time ago, there were no supers. Ours used to be a universe devoid of beings who possessed superpowers. Then, one day, The First created a pocket dimension out of sheer will. From that pocket dimension, The First drew out endless human potential that manifested as superpowers, that changed dozens of humans into supers in the blink of a eye. Since then, hundreds more have been born with superpowers. Others, well, fall into it. Sometimes literally. Maybe you're one of the lucky few that fell into a vat of toxic waste and acquired superpowers! At the Super Lair, we guide the new super on their journey to stardom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Our Story</b><br>

        The Super Lair all started with the Boss. The Boss saw so many supers struggle with their new reality of having superpowers, starting with the Boss's child, ChatterBox. ChatterBox fell into a vat of toxic waste at the age of 15, and gained superhuman abilities. ChatterBox did not take to being a super well at all. So, the Boss founded the Super Lair, to help new supers everywhere. The Boss's family moved to the Moon and built the Super Lair Headquarters in the Sea of Tranquility. Today, we span across the universe to serve supers like you.
