            <h4>Congratulations, you are now a super! Be it hero, villain, or something in between, you now have superpowers. No matter who you are or how you got here, there is something here for everyone. Supers, like you, gain infinite potential when they use the Super Lair for their super needs.</h4>
            <h2>A Humble Abode</h2>
            <p>
                Very important to a super, their personal super lair offers solace and acts as a base of operations. It can be as small as a studio apartment, or as tall as a skyscraper, or as isolated as an underground cave. You can be alone in your lair, hang out with your sidekick there, or your team can run experiments with you in the laboratory. No matter what the size, your lair should address your super needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Invitation</h2>
            <p>
                The Super Lair is a place to take a break, rest up, and plan your next steps on your super journey. In fact, if your superpowers include traveling through the internet, then by all means, come rest in the Super Lair's web servers at any time!
